This are the kubernetes manifests that for my personal GKE cluster.

I stood this up to explore technologies I use at work, but in more depth and from scratch.

Other than initial bootstrapping I use GitOps/ArgoCD to keep the cluster in sync with these manifests.

Most of the installs are from helm charts - https://artifacthub.io
